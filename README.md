# pyChat

End-to-end chat in python using socket module and PyQT. 


## Usage

Run the code in virtual environment.  
If it does not communicate try to turn off firewall and defender/antivirus.  
UI is pretty straightforward. 
Every user is both server and client, hence both nodes must enter target IP.
